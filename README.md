# **Meta Case Study: Transforming Year of Efficiency into Year of Engagement**

## **Project Summary**

I developed and presented data-driven **Strategies** to Janelle Gale, Meta's VP of HR Dept to transform their year of efficiency into year of engagement post 2023 massive layoffs

## **Key Insights:-
1) The highest percentage of employees belong to the ‘Meets Expectations’ (i.e. performance
appraisal rating 1) category (83.4%)
2) The mean values suggest that among all three categories of employees, Top Performers have the
highest turnover ratings (3.48)
3) Among these Top Performers, following insights were gained: -
a) In terms of Ethnicity, Blacks are in minority (5.1%) yet their mean values indicate that
they have the highest job satisfaction (3.05), immediate supervisor (2.24), trust in leadership (2.58)
ratings and the lowest turnover ratings (3.37)
b) In terms of Gender, employees who identify themselves as Others are in minority
(4.0%). Interestingly, their mean values imply they have the highest job satisfaction levels (2.70)
turnover intentions (3.65) and lowest immediate supervisor (1.67) and trust in leadership ratings
(2.41)
c) In terms of Age, Millennials are in majority (94.7%) and Generation Z are in minority
(1.3%)

## ** Actionable Recommendations:-
    1. Harness the power of AI
    2. Custom Recognition and Rewards Systems
    3. Diversity and Inclusion Management
    4. Compassionate Leadership
    5. Transparent Communication
    6. Foster a Sense of Community
